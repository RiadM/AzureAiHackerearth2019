# AzureAiHackerearth2019
*This is my MVP for the Azure AI challenge on Hacker Earth. Ecommerce on what's app using Azure AI infrastrcture.*

The basic Idea is to build an automated system so you could sell stuff directly on what's app. It would be like a shop where you buy whatever you need from the brand or person you like. In this hackathon I would like to at least make a prototype/MVP that could accomplish phase 2.

**Objectives / Phases** 
1. **Text recognition so we know what the customer want to buy.**
2. **Adding better understanding of what the user want, so we know if there's customisation to the order.**
3. Finding items to buy from a picture or a random descriptions. 
4. Accept other languages than english 
5. Adding speech recognition so people don't need to write what they want. 
6. Maybe start accepting payement by crypto
